## üìù Description

 </div>
 
The Learn Hub is an application that incorporates the technologies of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). The app is designed with the goal of providing users with a list of courses they can choose from to learn. To access a course, users/students must fill out an application. Based on the requirements set by the course teacher, the student's application will be either approved or denied. Once approved, the student will see the course listed among their approved courses.

Courses are created by teachers, and only teachers have the ability to create courses that are available for students to access after submitting an application and receiving approval.

## Features

- The app is a full-stack, single-page application
- Incorporates technologies of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
